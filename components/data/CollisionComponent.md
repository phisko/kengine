* Processed by the [CollisionSystem](../../systems/collision/CollisionSystem.md).

### onCollide

```cpp
putils::function<void(Entity & self, Entity & other), KENGINE_COLLISION_FUNCTION_SIZE> onCollide;
```

Its maximum size defaults to 64 and can be adjusted by defining the `KENGINE_COLLISION_FUNCTION_SIZE` macro.
