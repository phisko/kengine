# [model_creator](model_creator.hpp)

System that automatically creates new [model entities](../../data/model.md) when an entity's [graphics component](../../data/graphics.md) refers to a non-existing model. The system also takes care of assigning an [instance component](../../data/instance.md) to entities which don't have one.
