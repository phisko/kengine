# [magica_voxel](magica_voxel.hpp)

System that loads 3D models for entities with a [graphics component](../../../model_instance/data/graphics.md) by parsing the [magica_voxel format](https://github.com/ephtracy/voxel-model/blob/master/magica_voxel-file-format-vox.txt). 3D models are generated through the `PolyVox` library, with the vertex format found in the [polyvox component](../data/polyvox.md).
